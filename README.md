This was my first ever python project so I kept it simple 
It is a simple Python console game where the computer generates a random number and the player tries to guess it.
This project is designed for beginners to practice basic Python concepts like loops, conditions, and user input.

## 🕹️ How the Game Works

- The computer randomly selects a number within a given range.
- The player enters guesses through the keyboard.
- After each guess, the program tells the player whether the guess is:
  - Too high
  - Too low
  - Close
- You get 5 attempts to guess the number.
- The total number of attempts is displayed at the end.

  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python

2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.
